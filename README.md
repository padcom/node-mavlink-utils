# A set of utilities for node-mavlink

There are things that should be written once. One such thing is awaiting for an event to happen with timeout. This is just used too much to be written (and fixed) multiple times.

## Installation

To install the package issue the following command:

```bash
$ npm install --save node-mavlink-utils
```

## Usage

Please see the JS docs for each function, such as `waitFor()` or `waitForEvent()`.
